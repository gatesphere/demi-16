DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
  Name: K8581 - Sound Interface Device
  ID: 0x140fd321, Version: 0x8581
  Manufacturer: 0x0c72a5cd (KULOG_HW)


Description:
  The Kulog K8581 is a sophisticated sound interface device which includes the
  following features:
  
  - 4 voices
  - 4 different waveforms (sawtooth, triangle, square, and noise)
  - 4 waveform filters (highpass, lowpass, bandpass and NOTCH reject)
  - 16 volume levels
  - ADSR envelope generator
  - Frequencies from 0 - 4369Hz


Interrupt behaviour:
  When the K8581 recieves a HWI interrupt, it reads the A register and performs one of
  the following actions:


SET REGISTERS:
==========================================================================================

0x0000-0x0003: SET_ENVELOPE_(1-4)
  Reads the B register, which should be in the format aaaaddddssssrrrr. Sets the
  voice's envelope where a=attack rate, d=decay rate, s=sustain volume and
  r=release rate.
  a, d and r times (in milliseconds) are calculated by the formula 2^x where x is
  the a, d or r value.
  s is the sustain volume, and can be set to higher than the volume set by
  SET_ATTACK_VOLUMES.

0x0004: SET_ATTACK_VOLUMES
  Reads the B register, which must be in the format aaaabbbbccccdddd. Each nybble of the
  B register corresponds to a voice's attack volume.

0x0005: SET_SQUARE_DUTIES
  Reads the B register, which must be in the format aaaabbbbccccdddd. Each nybble
  of the B register sets the corresponding voice's square wave duty level.

0x0006-0x0009: SET_FREQUENCY_(1-4)
  Reads the B register, and sets the frequency of the voice to B/0xF

0x000A: SET_HIGHPASS_CUTOFF
  Reads the B register, and sets the highpass cutoff frequency to B/0xF

0x000B: SET_LOWPASS_CUTOFF
  Reads the B register, and sets the lowpass cutoff frequency to B/0xF

0x000C: SET_FILTER_RES_VOICES
  Reads the B register, which must be in the format rrrrrrrr00ppffff. The lower
  4 bits define which voices should be filtered. The 'p' bits define which filters
  should be applied, and use the following values:

    00=Bandpass filter (reduces levels above lowpass cutoff and below highpass
    cutoff)
    01=Highpass filter (reduces levels above lowpass cutoff)
    10=Lowpass filter (reduces levels below highpass cutoff)
    11=NOTCH reject filter (reduces levels between highpass and lowpass)

  The upper 8 bits define the resonance value of the filter.

0x000D: SET_WAVEFORM_PLAY_STOP
  Reads the B register, which must be in format sssseeeeaabbccdd. Each s is a
  voice's start (key on) bit, and each e is a voice's end (key off) bit.
  The lower 8 bits define which waveforms are used for the 4 voices. They use the
  following values: 

    00=Square
    01=Triangle
    10=Sawtooth
    11=Noise.

  When a voice's start bit is set, the voice will start playing its waveform at the
  frequency set by SET_FREQUENCY_(1-4). It's volume will rise to the attack volume
  set by SET_ATTACK_VOLUMES at the rate set by SET_ENVELOPE_(1-4), The volume will
  then decrease (or increase) to the sustain volume at the rate of the
  decay setting, and continue playing the voice at the sustain volume, until the 
  voice's end bit is set.

  When a voice's end bit is set, the voice's volume will decrease to zero at the
  release rate set by SET_ENVELOPE_(1-4).
